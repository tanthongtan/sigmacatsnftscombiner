alright dude make sure you have python installed then make a virtual environment with

```
python -m venv venv
```

activate the virtual environment

```
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

then install the requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

it should work

```
python generateimages.py
```

dont forget to check the generateimages.py file at the top, make sure the layers have the same name as the layers in the layers folder and make sure the order is right
